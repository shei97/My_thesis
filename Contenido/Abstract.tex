Plants are sessile organisms that face adverse conditions, both biotic and abiotic. These conditions trigger defensive responses that include increased activity of a group of enzymes. The different defense mechanisms are regulated by phytohormones, among them brassinosteroids (BRs), whose exogenous application or the modification of their content in plants can lead to an increase in the activity of these enzymes. This work aims to design a protocol that allows the subsequent evaluation of the effect of two synthetic BRs analogues on the defense enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in \textit{Raphanus sativus} plants. The work identifies the methodologies for the preparation of enzyme extracts that allow evaluating their activity. For the measurement of SOD, the acetone extraction methodology is established as correct, while the CAT and PPO enzymes are evaluated in aqueous extracts. The tests that allow the determination of the kinetic parameters of the enzymes SOD, CAT and PPO in crude enzyme extracts are established.
